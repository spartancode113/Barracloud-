                <p style="text-align:justify"><b><u>Why Buy a Domain</u></b></br>
                    Whilst I have completed the basic web development modules within university, I have never owned my
                    own
                    domain before, and as I begin my transition from student into the working world of computing I felt
                    that
                    it was best to get myself a website set up to act as an interactive portfolio, to show my education,
                    my
                    experiences and document my learnings from my projects.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify"><b><u>Buying a domain</u></b></br>
					<img src="/images/namecheap.png" alt=""
						 width="100%"
						 height="auto" />
                    As advertised on almost any YouTube video I watched regarding the subject on buying a domain
                    GoDaddy.com
                    was amongst the most recommended website to buy one for a good price, upon looking at their
                    offerings I
                    found that depending on the plan, length of time I wanted the domain, and added extras they offer,
                    the
                    price can mount up quickly. It made me think about things that had not occurred to me, SSL certs,
                    business email, hosting, all important things, after some searching, I came across a website called
                    Namecheap, a highly recommended domain reseller that offered more affordable prices than
                    GoDaddy.com. I
                    settled on the name barracloud.com (a play on my surname and cloud computing) and proceeded to
                    complete
                    my purchase using PayPal.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify"><b><u>Hosting</b></u></b></br>
                    <img src="/images/githubpages.jpg" alt=""
                         width="100%"
                         height="auto" />
                    Whilst Namecheap do offer hosting options and the creation of a website rather quickly with the
                    likes of
                    WordPress, I wanted to keep the costs down as low as possible, I also wanted a way to be able to be
                    in
                    control of the site if I wanted to make changes on the fly or work on them offline. GitHub now offer
                    a
                    service called pages, where you can host a website for free, whilst it has limitations such as no
                    deployment previews or asset optimisations, I felt these wouldn’t be required, as I will be
                    maintaining
                    my website using my editor I will be in control of any deployments and in control of any assets the
                    website will use.
                </p>


                <p style="text-align:justify"><b><u>Editor / Linking to Github</u></b></br>
                    In order to create or maintain a website I needed an IDE, as a student I have used a few in the
                    past, from notepad++, to Dreamweaver and WebStorm from JetBrains, as I’m most comfortable using the
                    WebStorm IDE and it has support for GitHub version control linking I felt it was an appropriate
                    choice. As I use other tools provided by JetBrains (pycharm, android studio) I went over to the
                    JetBrains Toolbox, I selected WebStorm Community version to let it install and opened it to allow it
                    to do any necessary updates before I linked my version control to it.</br></br>

                    <img src="/images/isntall%20web.jpg" alt=""
                         width="100%"
                         height="auto" />
                    </br></br>

                    First, I had to create a repository in order to link it to WebStorm so that the data had
                    somewhere to be stored, by logging into my GitHub account and clicking create new
                    repository, I set it to private, as this is my personal website, I don’t want anyone other
                    than myself having access to its content.</br></br>
                    <img src="/images/create%20repo.jpg" alt=""
                         width="100%"
                         height="auto" /></br></br>
                    Once the repository was created, I went back to WebStorm, selected new project from
                    version control, and pasted the repository URL into the provided box and authenticated it
                    with my GitHub log in details. With this now linked to my repository I could now start
                    creating content and use the Git option to push and commit new content to the repo, I can
                    also use it to fork the main branch if I wanted to work on pages and push them without
                    effecting the main website.</br></br>
                    <img src="/images/link%20with%20vc.jpg" alt=""
                         width="100%"
                         height="auto"/></br>
                </p>

				<p style="text-align:justify"><b><u>Linking to the Domain</u></b></br>
                In order to link where my site is hosted to my domain host I first had to get the relevant DNS
                details to link them together, checking out the Namecheap FAQ section I found a GitHub guide which
                provided me the details to just that. By going to my dashboard and selecting the manage option on my
                barracloud.com domain, it would take me to the settings page, to customise the DNS I had to select
                the advanced option and add in 5records using the ip address ranges for GitHub, and lastly add in a
                cname entry which will link directly to the GitHub repo just like my version control on webstorm
                does.</br></br>

                    <img src="/images/dnsdeets.png" alt=""
                         width="100%"
                         height="auto"/></br></br>


                           Once added all I had to do was wait up to 24 hours for the details to verify the website
                           and then head over to the GitHub pages settings section, within that there is an option
                           to use a custom domain, to which I sued barracloud.com and then enabled the enforce HTTPS
                           option to add a level of encryption to the site.
                    </br></br>
                    <img src="/images/customdomain.jpg" alt=""
                         width="100%"
                         height="auto"/>

				</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify"><b><u>Creating The site</u></b></br>
                Although I know some basic html, CSS and JavaScript knowledge, I wanted to get a website up and
                running fairly quickly, so I decided on the use of a free responsive template that I got from
                HTMLup.net, they provide a large range of free templates, being responsive is optimal so that the
                website loads and works properly on all screen resolutions and platforms, and I wanted something
                that scaled well on mobile and pc.</br>
                    <img src="/images/phantom.jpg" alt=""
                         width="100%"
                         height="auto"/></br>

                        As you can see from the image above my website is based off the Phantom template, using
                        WebStorm I imported the files to my project folders, I began to duplicate pages and
                        customise them to show what you see on the screen in front of you, though basic html and the
                        use of images on most pages, the website has a very minimalistic feel to it, with very low
                        overhead and maintance required. By creating a generic page with a basic layout I can also
                        use this for new pages as I add to my ongoing projects page.

                    </br></br>
                    <img src="/images/webstormcode.jpg" alt=""
                         width="100%"
                         height="auto"/></br>

				</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify"><b><u>Push to GitHub / Website goes live</u></b></br>
                The last part was to use git to push the website to the GitHub repository, once I was happy with my
                html and testing the website out using multiple browsers, I selected the green commit button in
                WebStorm, added my notes for what I had done for my session, selected the commit and push button.
                (Please ignore the errors and warnings, these are incorrectly used tags within paragraphs that will
                be fixed in future revisions).
                    </br></br>
                    <img src="/images/commit.jpg" alt=""
                         width="100%"
                         height="auto"/></br></br>


                    Once WebStorm confirms all the data has been successfully pushed to
                the repository, I can head over to barrracloud.com, and vola. Website is live and running.
                    </br></br>
                    <img src="/images/barracloud-com.jpg" alt=""
                         width="100%"
                         height="auto"/></br></br>

                <p style="text-align:justify"><b><u>Review</u></b></br>
                Overall this was a fun project, having to go back and relearn how to do some basic html, and css customisations in order to optimise the website a little
                better was certainly a challenge, in future there are a few things that i would like to tackle differently and i will defiendly be adding that to my projects list.

                <ul>
                <b>What id do differently</b>
                    <li>Self Hosting. Try to host from my own server</li>
                    <li>Research Content Management systems to lower html interaction time with new content</li>
                    <li>If using own server try certbot free SSL certificates</li>
                    <li>Possibly learn React for easier scaling</li>
                </ul>

                </p>
